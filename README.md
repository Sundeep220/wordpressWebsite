# wordpressWebsite


A wordpress website installed on nginx webserver using mySQL and PHP. 
- Used 3 containers: 
  - nginx container
  - mysql container
  - wordpress container
  
- I didn't have an digital ocean account so I could'nt host this website on a domain so I was not able to provide the SSL certificate using Let's encrypt.
